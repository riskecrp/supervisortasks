# Frontend Environment Variables

# Backend API URL
# Set this to your Railway backend endpoint
# 
# PRODUCTION (Default - connects to Railway backend):
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://supervisortasks-production.up.railway.app
#
# The application is designed to run on Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend)
# with Google Sheets as the data store (two-way synchronous).
#
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (Advanced - for developers only):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
# Requires running backend locally with Google credentials configured.
#
# MOCK DATA TESTING (Forces read-only fallback):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://invalid-url
# Warning: Mock data is READ-ONLY. No writes to Google Sheets.
#
# NOTE: If Railway backend is unavailable, the frontend automatically 
# falls back to read-only mock data with a warning banner.
# See TESTING.md for comprehensive testing guide.
